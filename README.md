Key Principles of Django

1: DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):
- Django encourages code reusability and efficiency by avoiding duplication.

2:MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller):
- Uses the MTV variant (Model-Template-View) for clear separation of concerns.

3: Loose Coupling:
- Components are independent, making the framework flexible and easier to maintain.

4: Reusable Components:
- Built-in features like authentication, admin interface, and ORM can be reused across projects.

5: Security by Default:
- Protects against common threats like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking.

6: Rapid Development:
- Simplifies development with less code and built-in functionalities.

7: Versatile and Scalable:
- Suitable for small projects and large-scale applications with high traffic.

8: Clean and Readable Code:
- Follows Python's philosophy of readability and simplicity.
